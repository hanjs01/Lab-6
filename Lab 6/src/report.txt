
		The main differences between the code in the .ump file and the code in the 3 java classes 
	is that the ump java files had a lot more methods that were not present in the 3 original java 
	classes. For example, the Account class created by the umple plugin had a constructor, an interface,
	and a toString to print the fields. The only methods in common were the getter methods.
	
		The plugin is useful because it makes the design of larger and more complicated programs much
	easier than just using the IDE. It is a lot easier to see the interactions and relationships between
	classes with the uml diagrams provided by umple.
