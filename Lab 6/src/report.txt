
		The main differences between the code in the .ump file and the code in the 3 java classes 
	is that the code in the .ump file doesn't declare items in the classes in the more official
	way of java classes. In the .java classes, the fields have the qualifier private in front, and 
	the classes have the qualifier public. In the .ump file the classes, fields and methods do not
	have qualifiers and the relationship between the classes is not as clear.
	
		The plugin could be useful for designing a large and complicated project in a simple and 
	easy to see manner. However, transferring the code to eclipse doesn't output the code expected.
